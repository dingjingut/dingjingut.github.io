###Asymmetric Underreactions and House Price Revisions
####Abstract
We develop a search and bargaining model where house buyers and sellers adjust their reservation prices upon information arrivals. Our empirical results suggest that sellers exhibit lower responsiveness to negative information shocks than buyers, although both buyers and sellers tend to underreact. In both the U.S. and China, a greater downward revision from a house's initial list price to its final list price is followed by a greater downward revision from its final list price to its sales price and lower neighborhood-level returns in subsequent months. In China, a house visitor's budget is positively related to the subsequent list-price revision, and two major policies adjusting the minimum down payment ratio had intended effects. Furthermore, a higher proportion of house visits during the listing period by visitors with a budget range below the at-visit list price predicts a greater downward revision from the final list price to the sales price. Negative policy information is less fully incorporated into revised list prices shortly after the policy changes than positive policy information.
